Capstone part2-mock up explnation:
I created 2 pages of the quizsite interface mock up.
 The 'Home' page indicate my quizsite brand, with click on 'pick up your level' it will change into the level meet user's pick, or user can simply click on start button to start with the default easist level. either way will lead user to the second page which shows the quiz detail.
